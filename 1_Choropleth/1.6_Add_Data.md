## Tutorial 1.6: Adding and Joining Attribute Data

**Summary**

**Tutorial 1.6** demonstrates how to add attribute data to the project and join layers *(Figure 1.6-1)*.

**Adding CSV Files**

In the Menu bar, click *Layer→Add Layer→Add Delimited Text Layer*. Click the three dots and add *unwp.csv* to the project. Expand the Records and Field Options by clicking the triangle and make sure that the *Discard empty fields* box is checked. 

Expand the *Geometry Definition* options and choose *No geometry (attribute only table)*. Click *Add* and close the window.

Since this is a CSV file, nothing new appears on the main window. It only contains attribute data, not location data.

Check if the data imported properly. Right-click *unwp* in the *Layers* panel and click *Open Attribute Table*. View the data to make sure you do not see any issues. When you're done, close the tab.

**Joining Spatial and Attribute Data**

We need to find a field that is the same between the two files. The computer will only make a join when the data in the two fields is exactly the same. Two potential fields are *GeoAreaCode* in the CSV file and *m49_cd* in the shapefile. If you open both tables and look at these fields, you will notice that one of them is a string (text) and the other is an integer (number). You can tell this because one field is aligned to the left (string) and the other is aligned to the right (integer). This means the computer does not see them as the "same" values. 

Because the *m49_cd* attribute is a string and not an integer, codes that start with 0 or 00 will not join correctly because the zeros are missing from the "GeoAreaCode" values. To change the attribute type for the *m49_cd* field, click the *Processing* menu, then *Toolbox* and *Refactor*, selecting integer as the data type. Under *Refactored*, choose *Save to File* and give the new output a name of *UN_Countries_Pacific_Refactored* and click the *Run* button. 

Additional information about changing attribute types in QGIS is available at: https://wiki.tuflow.com/QGIS_Change_Attribute_Type

Then right-click on *UN_Countries_Pacific_Refactored* in the *Layers* panel and click *Properties*. Click the *Joins* tab.

Click the green plus sign (![](1.6_Add_Data_images/image_1.png)). Join the data in this file to your CSV *unwp*.

The *Join layer* should be your *unwp* file. 

The *Join field* is the header of a field in the CSV file. The *Join field* is called *GeoAreaCode* and the *Target field* is called *m49_cd*. 

Click *OK* and then click *OK* again.

Open the Attribute Table for *UN_Countries_Pacific_Refactored*. View the data to see if it has been joined correctly. Scroll to the end to find the field *unwp_2025*. If some rows are NULL, that is okay. These are usually countries that do not have data. If all countries are NULL, then there was an issue with your *Join*. 

**Creating a Permanent SHP Join**

Once you are satisfied with your join, you need to make the join permanent in a new file. Save *UN_Countries_Pacific_Refactored* as a new shapefile. Right click *UN_Countries_Pacific_Refactored* in the *Layers* panel and click *Export→Save features as…*

Click the three dots and name your file *UN_wom_par_eiv.shp*, as you do not need a full geodatabase for this tutorial. Confirm *Add saved file to the map* is selected and click *OK*. 

Remove all layers except for *UN_wom_par_eiv*. Right click each file and click *Remove Layer…* and then *OK*. 

Now you have added all the necessary layers and joined them together. Save and proceed to [**Tutorial 1.7**: Editing the Attribute Table](/1_Choropleth/1.7_Edit_Attribute_table_Map_Algebra.md).
