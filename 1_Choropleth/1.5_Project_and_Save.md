## Tutorial 1.5: Creating a Project and Setting the Projection

**Summary**

**Tutorial 1.5** demonstrates how to add locational data to QGIS and to project the map (*Figure 1.5-1*).

**Creating a Project**

Open QGIS. Click *New Project*.

In the Menu bar (top of the screen) click *Layer→Add Layer→Add Vector Layer*.

The *Data Source Manager | Vector* window will open. 

Set the *Source Type* as *Directory*.

Under *Source*, change the *Type* to *OpenFileGDB*.

Click the icon with three dots (![](1.5_Project_and_Save_images/image_1.png)) toward the right of the screen. Navigate to your *SDG_choropleth_tutorial* folder. Select the *UN_Countries_GDB.gdb* folder and then click *Add*.

###### Figure 1.5-2: When opening the Geodatabase, only select the *BNDA_simplified* file.

You will be presented with multiple shapefiles to open. The only file that you need to open is *BNDA_simplified* (*Figure 1.5-1*). 

Select only the layer you need and then click *Add Layers*. After that, click *Close*.

**Setting the Shapefile Projection**

Close this window. There is a world map on the screen. This map is already ***projected*** (*Figure 1.5-3*) because you downloaded it from the UN. However, some other sources that you may download a shapefile from, like [Natural Earth](https://www.naturalearthdata.com/), provide files that use only a geographic coordinate system to tell the software how to read the file, but this is not a projected coordinate system.

> ***Projection***: the process of transferring geospatial data from a three-dimensional model of the Earth to a two-dimensional or "flat" map (see **Section 2.4**)

###### Figure 1.5-3: World map projections, book Figure 2.4-2.

Since you are making a choropleth map, which relies on area, you want to reduce distortion of area. However, this means you will distort shape. The Eckert IV projection, a common ***equal-area projection*** for world maps, is a good choice for choropleth maps, and it is what the UN file is projected in.

> ***Equal-area projection***: a projection that preserves the relative areas of polygon features, often heavily distorting shape as a result

You might have noticed that this projection is not very friendly for mapping the Pacific because it gets cut in two at the end of the map. We can recenter the projection so that the Pacific is in the middle instead of at the edge. 

Because this workshop is only a few hours, I have already done this for you to save a little time. Remove the *BNDA_simplified* layer by right-clicking its name in the Layers and choosing *Remove Layer*.

Next, download [the recentred data](https://github.com/amy-griffin/MappingSDGsTechnicalSupplement-PGSRC-2025/tree/main/1_Choropleth/1.5_Project_and_Save_data) and save it to your *SDG_choropleth_tutorial* folder. Unzip the file and then follow these instructions: 

In the Menu bar (top of the screen) click *Layer→Add Layer→Add Vector Layer*.

The *Data Source Manager | Vector* window will open. 

Click the icon with three dots (![](1.5_Project_and_Save_images/image_1.png)) toward the right of the screen. Navigate to your *SDG_choropleth_tutorial* folder. Select *UN_Countries_Pacific.shp* and then click *Add*.

Now you should see a map that is more appropriate for the Pacific region.


**Saving the Project**

Save your project. In the Menu bar, go to *Project→Save as…* and name your project something memorable like *SDG_choropleth_tutorial_map*. Save it in the project folder.

**Setting the Scale**

At this stage it is important to think about ***scale***. The polygons representing location can have generalized or complex linework depending on the scale (*Figure 1.5-4*). The UN shapefile is already simplified for your purposes, so you did not have to do anything for this step.

> ***Cartographic scale***: the ratio between a distance represented on a map and the corresponding distance in the real world (see **Section 2.6**)

Now you have your location data projected properly. Proceed to [**Tutorial 1.6**: Adding and Joining Attribute Data](/1_Choropleth/1.6_Add_Data.md).
